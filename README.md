# Hangman

creation of a hanged man with html and js language and bootstrap
for my web dev training (the programming language was not specified)
[Lien](https://gabrielju.github.io/Hangman/).

## Development comments
development is to spend just some worry to explain to the different var to coexist

## possible improvement

the hanged man is still basic we could of course give several types of word (abject, animals, flowers ...) and functions like changing the background color in case of a good or bad answer.
